I still think it's possible to implement. One approach that might work:\r\n\r\n* before reformatting file, check if file has a dirty buffer,\r\n* if file has dirty buffer, add file into a queue\r\n* on every reformat, try to empty queue\r\n"

Question is whether this should belong in the SBT plugin or in the text editor integrations as some sort of \"reformat on unfocus\" action.\r\n\r\nMy problem with implementing this as part of the SBT plugin is:\r\n1. It's limited to text editors that create swap files in the same directory as the file. For example, I set my vim to put the swap files in `/tmp` and IntelliJ doesn't leave any swap files.\r\n2. It would be tricky to get right since the current `reformatOnCompileSettings` implementation taps into the incremental compiler to know which files to format. The SBT plugin would need to know when the swap file is removed to know that it should reformat the source file.\r\n\r\nBy integrating this directly, I imagine the user experience would be smoother. However, if someone wants to take a stab at this in the SBT plugin, the relevant line of code is here: https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/blob/6adefe05cc43c914569e181c1061153dafd88528/scalafmtSbt/src/main/scala/org/scalafmt/sbt/HasScalaFmt.scala#L46\r\n"
