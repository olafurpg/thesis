      "body": "I agree that aligning sequences of statements by certain tokens, like your examples, would be super cool. Also, other popular formatters like clang-format do this for specific cases. However, the devil lies in the details. To help me understand your expectations, could you answer these questions:\r\n\r\n* Should this feature be enabled globally or only for specific blocks? If enabled for block, how would you enable it? If enabled globally, how would you format the following?\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nobject A {\r\n  val abba = \"cool\"\r\n  @inline\r\n  val easyCase = 'best\r\n\r\n  val x = 2\r\n  final val itGetsTricker = 22222\r\n  var foobar = \"kaz\"\r\n  def add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b\r\n  val x = mutable.ListBuffer(1, 2)\r\n  x += 3\r\n\r\n  // Also align comments?\r\n  val iHaveComment = \"value\" // this is comment 1\r\n  val meToo = \"bananas are the best\" // this is comment 2\r\n  val waterloo = 'nocomment\r\n\r\n  // should we alignt named arguments?\r\n  function(a = 1,\r\n           baz = \"bar\",\r\n           kazam = boom)\r\n  function2(a = 1, // does = in function2 align with = in function?\r\n            baz = \"bar\",\r\n            kazam = boom)\r\n\r\n  // what about default values?\r\n  def function(a: Int = 1,\r\n               baz2: String = 2,\r\n               baz: String,\r\n               kazam: Symbol = 'boom): Int = 2\r\n  var shouldThisAlignWithFunction_? = _\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Do you only want to align equal signs or do you also want to align by other tokens? If other tokens, which ones? For example, `=>` in pattern matching, opening parenthesis in case class or `extends` in a sealed trait. Hypothetical example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nsealed abstract class Super\r\ncase class A  (a:   Int)           extends Super\r\ncase class Ba (baa: Int, a:   B)   extends Super\r\ncase class Baa(ba:  Int, baa: Baa) extends Super\r\n```"

Rather than focusing too much on covering many cases, I suggest hitting only the super common ones from \"first principles\" and inferring all the rest from the incoming code. If two or more lines have the same token in the same columns, surrounded by whitespace on both sides, then that is a candidate for alignment to preserve. That's likely to be too weak by itself, but it can be strengthened with additional heuristics - especially of course if it's three or more lines with a token in the same position."

Please upvote https://github.com/scalameta/scalameta/issues/358 to convince Eugene this would be a worthwhile feature in scala.meta.\r\n\r\nFor the sbt and the `colors` Map examples, the common pattern is that they're lists (application arguments, sbt source file statements) of infix applications. How about specifying which infix operators align together as some sort of `Set[Set[Token]]`?\r\n\r\nFor `val/def`, I believe the most common case is to align by `=` and comments.  Scalafmt could align those tokens if it sees a sequence of statements of same type (e.g. `Defn.Val`, `Defn.Def`), which are not separated by a blank line.  This would ignore differences between statements like annotations or modifiers, is that OK?\r\n\r\nAs @paulp suggests, this might be a good start from which we could derive a more general solution. Maybe something similar to AlignTab, thanks for the link.\r\n\r\nPS. with 0.1.6 out I've started working on 0.2.0, which will make configuration much easier. The currently useless `ScalaStyle` trait will become a `ScalafmtConfig` case class.\r\n"

[Here](https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt/commit/b990ec78647db1a27621661b4f26265882d1a423#diff-ae5748146f114992c73f16c549cd5332R262) is the diff from formatting all files in scalafmt with  the `defaultWithAlign` style.\r\n\r\nYou can find documentation for using a custom style or defining custom align tokens in [the user docs](http://olafurpg.github.io/scalafmt/#Configuration).\r\n\r\nThe docs may be incomplete, don't hesitate to poke at me for more info. Let me know what you think :smile:, I'm especially happy to get more test cases."
